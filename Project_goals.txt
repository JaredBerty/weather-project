1. Compilation of Weather Station Data:

Collect a list of all known weather stations that contribute weather data.
Create a database to store weather station information, including station names and their respective IDs used by different organizations.
Populate the database with station data, ensuring each station is paired with all known IDs it may have.

2. Querying Historical Weather Data:

Develop a function to query historical weather data from your database based on location and date.
Retrieve weather data for a specific location on a particular date from all available years of record.
Store the retrieved weather data for further analysis.

3. Analysis and Trend Identification:

Analyze the historical weather data to identify trends, patterns, or anomalies.
Use statistical methods or machine learning techniques to extract insights from the data.
Identify correlations between weather variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and other factors of interest.

4. Assumptions and Predictions:

Use the insights gained from historical weather data analysis to make assumptions or predictions about future weather conditions.
Develop models or algorithms to forecast weather patterns on specific dates or within certain time frames based on historical trends.

5. Validation and Iteration:

Validate assumptions and predictions by comparing them with observed weather data.
Iterate on your analysis and prediction models based on new data and feedback.
